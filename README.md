# NQueenSearch
Creates an N-Queen Board and solves it using the Genetic Algorithm. Submitted for CS420, Artificial Intelligence.


NQueenBoard.java instantiates a board, while the Coordinates.java contains the coordinate information about the board and the horizontal, vertical and diagonal positions in relation to each Queen. It also watches for collisions. GeneticAlgBoard.java is solves the N-Queen problem using the Genetic Algorithm, which is complex so it got its own class. NQueen.java prints and shows this and the other algorithm, Steepest Hill Climb.

The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. Generally, the expected output is a binary matrix which has 1s for the blocks where queens are placed.
